# Introducing GIS with the opensource software QGIS
[image]

QGIS is a free and opensource software compatible with mac, PC and Linux systems.

You can be part of the community at [qgis.org](https://qgis.org/en/site/)!

## Workshop Resources
 - Software - access via the [QGIS download page](https://qgis.org/en/site/forusers/download.html)
 - Data - 

## Workshop Goals
By the end of this workshop, you will have familiarity with geospatial data, understand the importance of location information and know how to create a map!

## Workshop Sections
- [What is GIS?](#what-is-gis)
- Why QGIS?
- The QGIS Interface
- Loading Data
- Symbology
- Classifying Data
- Adding a Basemap - Plugins
- Making a Print Layout


## What is GIS?
And more importantly, why might we want to use it?

GIS stands for either Geographic Information System or Geographic Information Science.

"Geographic Information System" typically refers to the software, like QGIS, we use to create spatial data and to investigate spatial relationships between that data.

"Geographic Information Science" is the framework we use to ask questions about the spatial relationship between data. This framework is broader than working within certain GIS-specific softwares like QGIS. You will also hear people use the phrase "Geospatial Science."

Why is location information important? The knowlege gained by spatial data enhances our understanding. For example, we may assume that our friend who lives in the city/county of Denver has easy access to a LOT of good restaurants because the numbers say the ratio of restaurants to the area of the county is high. But when we map out that many restaurants are downtown and realize our friend lives out by Denver International Airport, we have a different perspective.

In addition, humans are largely visual. We respond well to seeing information presented in graphs and maps. By using GIS software, we can share our message quickly by *carefully* presenting it in the form of a map. (**How** we show our data on a map will change our message, but that's for a different workshop.)

## Why QGIS?

QGIS is an open source, community-driven desktop GIS software that allows users to visualize and analyze spatial data in a variety of ways. There are many reasons to use QGIS, but here are a few:

- It's a robust, powerful desktop GIS
- Runs on all major platorms: Mac, Linux, & Windows
- Free of charge, all access (no paid add-ons or extensions)
- Frequent updates & bug fixes
- Responsive, enthusiastic community
- Integration with other geospatial tools & programming languages like R, Python, & PostGIS
- Access to analysis tools from other established software like GRASS and SAGA
- Native access to open data formats like geoJSON & GeoPackage
- Comes in more than 40 languages, making it easier to work with a larger variety of colaborators
- Growing use by local, state, federal, and international governments
